# Android Devices (Compute, Storage, Networking)
I've thought about this type of (overall) project a couple of times, and each time it has evolved. Initially, I wanted to use a Panasonic Toughbook, then I wanted to use a SOC (Raspberry Pi), then I shifted to a MiniPC (NUC type). Today (figuratively), I realize that the abundance and prevalence of Android devices make them a better-suited candidate for this project. I've thrown away quite a few older phones, but i've also collected quite a few of them in recent years.
