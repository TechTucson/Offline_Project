# Offline_Project
- I've been interested in emergency communications and cyber preparedness for some time now. I guess I should semi-define those two terms before I get going. Yes this is going to be one of those projects where I talk about the grid down scenario :), and by grid I mean power and internet. Maybe I should focus on shelter, water, and food, but what's the fun in that? Don't worry, we'll touch on some of that.  I've seen some projects out there that inspired me to add my own two cents into this topic, it's going to be a spinoff of various in-flight and some completed projects.

## Menu
There's always the chicken and the egg conversation, do I start with power or the devices I am going to power? This is the initial thoughts of how things would work :) Modify things to fit your needs.

  - We'll need to power things, since we're working with Android devices (phones and tablets), they have internal batteries and charging them is essentially universal. We'll need a power source (i.e. batteries) and a way to replenish that power source (i.e. solar).

## Goals
- Let's start off with power; all electronics need power. A Car Battery, A Cheap Solar Kit, Maybe an Inverter.
- Then we'll need a local network. I am sure you have a WiFi router lying around. (We might get a DC-to-DC converter to power it directly from our battery, no need to waste electricity converting it twice.)
- While we all love SOCs, I can't find those in the grocery store, but I can find a lot of Android devices :) Our main source of computing and storage needs will be accomplished by Android devices. 
- We'll need information. https://kiwix.org/en/ to the rescue.
- Reading is boring, I want to play games and stuff. Yeah, my kids say the same thing.
- What about movies and music? ( What about them?)
  - These are a bit more difficult to tackle (storage constraints), but we'll tackle them too.
- Communications, yes, this is what started it all for me
  - GMRS/Repeaters
  - HAM Radio-- NVIS
  - Meshtastic/Lora
- Long Range Wifi
- House, Neighborhood, County
