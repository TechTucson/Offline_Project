# Offline_Project
I've been interested in emergency communications and cyber preparedness for some time now. I guess I should semi-define those two terms before I get going. Yes this is going to be one of those projects where I talk about the grid down scenario :), and by grid I mean power and internet. Maybe I should focus on shelter, water, and food, but what's the fun in that? Don't worry, we'll touch on some of that.  I've seen some projects out there that inspired me to add my own two cents into this topic, it's going to be a spinoff of various in-flight and some completed projects.

## Goals
- Let's start off with power; all electronics need power. A Car Battery, A Cheap Solar Kit, Maybe an Inverter.
- Then we'll need a local network. I am sure you have a WiFi router lying around. (We might get a DC-to-DC converter to power it directly from our battery, no need to waste electricity converting it twice.)
- We'll need something to host our information. We all love Raspberry Pis, well, I don't have one, I have a RockPI. ( While we all love SOCs, I can't find those in the grocery store, but I can find a lot of Android devices :) Down the road, we'll move away from SOC, at least for this project thingy. 
- We'll need information. https://kiwix.org/en/ to the rescue.
- Reading is boring, I want to play games and stuff. Yeah, my kids say the same thing.
- What about movies? ( What about them?)
  - These are a bit more difficult to tackle, but we'll tackle it too.
- Communications, yes, this is what started it all for me
  - GMRS/Repeaters
  - HAM Radio-- NVIS
  - Meshtastic/Lora
- Long Range Wifi
- House, Neighborhood, County

# Requirements
- Some electronics and stuff
- Time
