- I had some car batteries around that I tend to keep for different things
- I also have been collecting wires and knick-knacks for the last forever-time.
  - Things that are useful here:
    - 12V Cigarette Lighter Adapter (CLA)
    - 12V CLA  USB (Micro,Mini,C) Adapter Charger
    - 12V CLA Invertor 120V
